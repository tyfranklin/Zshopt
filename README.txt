This script allows you to use the 'shopt' command in zsh (or other bash like shells).
To use this, simply add the 'shopt' script to a location on your $PATH.
(I suggest /usr/bin)
Or add the following line to your .zshrc
alias shopt='/path/to/shopt'

If you don't have a .zshrc you can use the one provided in this repo.
Or you can append the .zshrc in this repo to your existing .zshrc.
$ cat .zshrc >> ~/.zshrc

(Note the included .zshrc assumes you push the 'shopt' script in /usr/bin.
